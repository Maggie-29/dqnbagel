# Aircraft War + DQN

This javascript demo is a modified version based on [Seann999â€™s work](https://github.com/seann999/dodge_tfjs) built with [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/). You can mess up with all the hyperparameters and settings below to see what interesting things are going to happen.

For the python version, please check [DQN-Playground-for-Aircraft-War](https://github.com/Maggie-29/DQN-Playground-for-Aircraft-War)
